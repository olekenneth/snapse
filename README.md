#  Snapse

Snapse is a Snapchat-like client for Matrix.org. To get my friends and family to use the Matrix.org-network I saw a clear need; Snapchat and easy image sharing. Element, FluffyChat etc are focused on text based chats. I wanted to create an easy-to-use, quick, image oriented client. So this is my attempt.
